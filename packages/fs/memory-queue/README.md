# @deepseek-ai/dsh-memory-queue

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`dsh-memory-queue` serializes concurrent dispatches to configured tools — `wiki_write` by default — through the `tools/execute` waterfall. Mounting it gives the memory vault single-writer ordering without modifying `dsh-tool-memory-filesystem`: calls to listed tools acquire a shared FIFO promise chain, while every other tool dispatches unimpeded. With `crossProcessLock` enabled, the serialized section additionally holds an `mkdir`-based lock directory in the vault root so separate dsh processes cannot interleave writes. The plugin registers no tools of its own.

## Use this package

Mount alongside the memory filesystem plugin:

```yaml
- name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-memory-filesystem'
- name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-memory-queue'
```

### Configure the queue

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `toolNames` | `string[]` | `['wiki_write']` | Tool names whose dispatches serialize through one shared chain. |
| `vaultRoot` | `string` | `''` → `<session cwd>/.dsh/memory/` | Vault root hosting the lock directory; same per-call resolution as the memory tools. |
| `crossProcessLock` | `boolean` | `false` | Acquire a lock directory in the vault root around each serialized dispatch so separate processes cannot interleave calls. |
| `laneArgument` | `string` | `''` | String tool argument whose value scopes a private lane and lock directory — e.g. `id` so writes to different notes run in parallel while same-note writes still serialize. |
| `lockStaleMs` | `number` | `15000` | A lock unrefreshed this long counts as abandoned and is reclaimed; must exceed `2 × lockHeartbeatMs`. |
| `lockHeartbeatMs` | `number` | `2000` | Interval at which the holder refreshes the lock directory mtime. |
| `lockTimeoutMs` | `number` | `30000` | Give up waiting for a held lock after this many milliseconds. |
| `lockRetryMs` | `number` | `100` | Delay between lock acquisition attempts. |

## Understand the implementation

The plugin installs one `ctx.on('tools/execute', …)` waterfall listener. Dispatches whose tool name is in `toolNames` are appended to a single promise chain; each call runs `next()` only after the previous serialized call settles, so failure of one call cannot stall later ones. Unlisted tools pass straight through to `next()`. With `crossProcessLock`, the serialized section wraps `next()` in an `mkdir` lock at `<vault>/.memory-queue.lock`: `mkdir` is atomic on POSIX filesystems, so exactly one process holds the lock. The holder writes a diagnostic `owner.json` and an incrementing counter to `<lock>/heartbeat` every `lockHeartbeatMs`. With `laneArgument`, the chain and lock are sharded by that argument's value: distinct values get `<vault>/.memory-queue.lanes/<sha1>.lock` directories and run concurrently, while equal values share a lane. A waiter declares a lock stale only when the observed liveness token — the heartbeat counter when present, the directory mtime for locks without one (foreign writers, older versions) — fails to change for `lockStaleMs` measured on its own local clock. Liveness is change-detection, never an absolute-time comparison, so cross-machine clock skew and weak NFS mtime coherence cannot make a live lock look stale. A caller waiting past `lockTimeoutMs` fails the dispatch loudly.

## Model Experience

None, as the plugin registers no tools, prompts, or results of its own — it only reorders dispatches to tools other packages own.

#### KV Cache effect

The wrapper does not change the request header, system prompt, or tool list.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **Lock is advisory** — `crossProcessLock` only guards processes that mount this plugin; a writer outside the waterfall (another tool, a shell command) can still race the vault. `wiki_write`'s atomic publish keeps such races from corrupting files, and its optional `baseVersion` check turns lost updates into loud conflicts for cooperative callers.
- **One chain per lane** — calls sharing a `laneArgument` value serialize against each other even across different listed tools; per-tool lanes are deferred.
- **Legacy locks need an observation window** — a lock directory without a `heartbeat` file (hand-made, or an older plugin version) is proven dead only after its mtime stays unchanged for `lockStaleMs` of local observation, so reclaiming a dead legacy lock takes one full window.
